INTRODUCTION                                           *winshift-introduction*

WinShift lets you move windows, not only around each other, but also in and
out of rows and columns.

USAGE                                         *Win-Move-mode* *winshift-usage*

Enter Win-Move mode by calling `:WinShift`. This will target your current
window for moving. You can move the window either by using |hjkl| or the arrow
keys. You can move the window to any of the far ends of the viewport by
pressing one of `HJKL`, or shift + any arrow key. Exit Win-Move mode by
pressing `q` / `<esc>` / `<C-c>`.

CONFIGURATION                                                *winshift-config*

Example configuration with default settings:
>
    -- Lua
    require("winshift").setup({
      highlight_moving_win = true,  -- Highlight the window being moved
      focused_hl_group = "Visual",  -- The highlight group used for the moving window
      moving_win_options = {
        -- These are local options applied to the moving window while it's
        -- being moved. They are unset when you leave move mode.
        wrap = false,
        cursorline = false,
        cursorcolumn = false,
        colorcolumn = "",
      }
    })

COMMANDS                                                   *winshift-commands*

                                                                   *:WinShift*
:WinShift [direction]
                        When called without [direction]: starts Win-Move mode
                        targeting the current window for moving. For how to
                        use Win-Move mode, see |Win-Move-mode|. With
                        [direction] perform a one-shot move operation on the
                        current window, moving it in the given direction.
                        [direction] can be one of:
                            `left`, `right`, `up`, `down`, `far_left`,
                            `far_right`, `far_up`, `far_down`

                        The `far_` variants will move the window to the far
                        end of the viewport in the given direction.

CAVEATS                                                     *winshift-caveats*

Moving through windows with 'winfixwidth' and / or 'winfixheight' can be a bit
wonky. It will work, but it can be a bit hard to follow the movement, and the
fixed window might end up with different dimensions after. This is simply a
consequence of vim being forced to resize the window due to there not being
enough space to adhere to the fixed window's preferred dimensions.
